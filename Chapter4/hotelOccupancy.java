/* A hotelâ€™s occupancy rate is calculated as follows:

    Occupancy rate = Number of Rooms Occupied + Total number of rooms

Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for each floor of a hotel. The program 
should start by asking for the number of floors in the hotel. A loop should then iterate 
once for each floor. During each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of 
rooms on the floor and the number of them that are occupied. After all the iterations, the 
program should display the number of rooms the hotel has, the number of them that are 
occupied, the number that are vacant, and the occupancy rate for the hotel. */
